# README FIRST
# 1. If you don't have unit tests, remove that section.
# 2. If your collection depends on other collections ensure they are installed,
#    add them to the "test-deps" input.
# 3. For the comprehensive list of the inputs supported by the
#    ansible-community/ansible-test-gh-action GitHub Action, see
#    https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ansible-test.
# 4. If you need help please ask in #ansible-community on the Libera.chat IRC
#    network.
